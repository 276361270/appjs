# AppJS

AppJS is an SDK to develop desktop applications using node. Or at least
it is going to be!

The goal is to facilitate native app development using
tools every developer is familiar with nowadays: HTML/CSS/JS

_Attention:_ You should not use AppJS before we bump version to 
v0.1.0, it is under heavy development.
